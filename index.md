## About Me

I am a current student in the Northeastern University Align Master of Science in Computer Science program in Boston, Massachusetts with an expected graduation date in August 2025. Before enrolling at Northeastern, I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and a Bachelor in Business Administration with a Concentration in Accounting from King’s College in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

## About My Advisor

Dr. David Choffnes is an associate professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, Executive Director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute, and affiliate faculty at the Center for Law, Innovation and Creativity (CLIC). His research is primarily in the areas of distributed systems and networking, with a recent focus on privacy, security, transparency, and mobile systems.

His research approach is to combine science and engineering to understand and improve the performance, reliability, and security of Internet systems. With respect to science, he empirically measures computer systems that interact over the Internet to understand how well they match existing models and assumptions, then investigates the root causes for violations of those models/assumptions—often then leading to the design of new models. In many cases, observations also suggest the design of systems that exploit previously unknown information about how our Internet-enabled systems work, and as an engineer he builds and evaluates such systems in a way that other researchers, users, and policy makers can benefit from the result. To date, the software artifacts of his research have more than one million users, and his research teams have produced reports and datasets that informed additional research, policy debates, regulators, and legislators.
