## About Me

I am pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, with an expected graduation date of August 2025. Prior to joining Northeastern, I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and a Bachelor of Business Administration in Accounting from King's College in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

## About My Project

Voice assistants such as Amazonâ€™s Alexa, are becoming increasingly pervasive in our homes. While convenient, these systems also raise important privacy concerns. One of them is understanding to what extent they use or share information from past user interactions.

In this project, we will investigate how voice assistant interactions may affect user profiling activities, what the risks of such profiling activities are, and if such activities have been disclosed on the privacy policy of the devices. For example, if a user frequently asks a voice assistant for recipes, will they receive more suggestions and advertisements that are food-related? If yes, was this disclosed in the privacy policy of the device?
To perform this investigation, we will focus on the three most popular voice assistants (Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple Siri), accessing them using any of the interfaces available to us, including smart speakers, mobile apps, integration SDKs.
This project is organized into three research activities: (1) the creation of user profiles, such as a list of questions aimed at simulating particular user profiles, followed by experiments to actually expose the voice assistants to such questions; (2) the creation of a way to probe the voice assistants for evidence of customization, such as curating a list of control questions, followed by experiments to check if the voice assistants exhibit any sign of profiling; (3) search of evidence of profiling also beyond the voice assistants, for example searching for targeted advertising in Amazon and Google searches.
