title: Week 9 - Complete Sets and Collecting Data
---

  In the aftermath of account takedowns, I was finally able to finish running the round 1 questions for all 190 accounts! Barring any dramatic mid-experiment takedowns, I now just need to continue to run the weekly queries until data collection can cease. However, we have not observed any accounts being removed after one week of activity â€“ based on this precedent, I am optimistic that we will be in the clear by early next week.
  Apple experiments will be run soon. For the most part, our tasks now consist of collecting data and waiting for profiling to occur. Though there are not any novel developments to report this week, I am looking forward to being able to analyze the collected data in a few weeks!
