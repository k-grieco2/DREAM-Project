title: Week 3 - Preliminary Experiments, Pt. 1
---

  Throughout my third week, I continued to run the preliminary experiments for each set of Google queries. Parameters we are looking at varying include the queries, frequency of repetition, and (for preliminary experiments only) medium of inquiry. A set of web experiments will be run as a control; we believe they will return results similar to the voice assistants, but this hypothesis remains to be tested. Collecting data from these preliminary experiments will help to inform our methodology moving forward for when we perform the larger scale set of experiments for the project. 
	We also discovered a more sustainable way to create accounts on each platform. A problem we were anticipating having was the need to create a large number of accounts that pose as real users on all three platforms, as most begin to require a phone number for verification after the platforms detect more than one accounts being created in one location. Though I will not detail the solution we found here due to its potential for abuse, it seems promising, and we began mass account creation for the experiments. Overall, week 3 was very productive!
