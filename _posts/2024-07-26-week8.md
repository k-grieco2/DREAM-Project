title: Week 8 - Continuing Experiments
---

  Things went much more smoothly this week than last week. Now that we have some idea of how much account creation activity in one spot might cause the Google algorithm to destroy our accounts, we were careful to vary locations/IP addresses enough so that we would minimize the amount of account losses occurring. An interesting pattern I have observed is that the purging of bots seems to happen around the same time every week. Though having seen this occur two weeks in a row is by no means a definitive analysis, forming a hypothesis has helped us to adapt our account creation practices.
	Though we still lost some accounts this week, I am steadily making progress towards the total 190 experiments. By the middle of next week, I should be able to complete round 1 for all accounts. However, since some will be listening to query set 2 next week, I will have to be careful to group everything in a way that I can manage everything properly. I will continue to update my experiment calendar as needed.
	The other students on the project were able to successfully complete the Amazon experiments this week. If all goes well, by the end of next week we will have results and data to analyze! We are all very excited to look at the profiling trends on a larger scale.
